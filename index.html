            <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>I live in Port Perry, Ontario-a small town in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, with my daughter and 5 cats.  I briefly worked in the fashion industry, then moved into customer service with a large well-known tech company and have been there 19 years in various capacities. My journey into tech began when I started building personal websites through Wordpress a few years ago when I was looking for something new and challenging but was never satisfied with the limitations of themes.
          </div>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p> I wanted to customize my pages so decided to learn how to code my own site, which ended up sparking a passion in me that I didn't know was there. When I built my first website from scratch, I realized I found something that delighted the geek in me and my creative side. I've started working part-time as a front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code resulting in a beautiful website that is exactly what YOU want.</p>
